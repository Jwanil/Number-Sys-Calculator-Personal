# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


For running this app, you will require node installed in your device. 
To install node, follow this link:

- https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager

After installing node, open terminal and run

```bash
    npm -v
```

After that open the file in vscode and open the terminal and run

```bash
    npm install node
```

This will install node modules required for the app.

After this, run

```bash
    npm run dev
```
This will run the development server and run the app successfully.
To open the app in your browser, just click the localhost link in the terminal.
